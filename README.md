# SudokuSolver2.0
A number of algorithms for sudoku puzzles. 

Inspired by the project I did in high school for AP Computer Science, I originally was to solve a sudoku puzzle without recursion and ended up enjoying the game. I will eventually add that version (SudokuSolver1.0 - written in Java) to the repo.

This project is a revamp in Python using new techniques that I was not allowed to use (recursion), new methods I have discovered while playing sudoku, and various methods I have found online (to be added). 

I hope to eventually add in time complexity analysis for all algorithms, the ability to generate solvable sudoku puzzles, and a user friendly way to play sudoku.
